                    <h2> Kyoto is a city in Japan</h2>
                    <h5>

                  
                    Kyoto City isn't just another dot on Japan's map;
                    it's an incredible city woven with tales older than time. 
                    From its most famous temples, drawing both Japanese people 
                    and foreign tourists alike, to quiet neighborhoods where the 
                    spirit of Old Japan lingers, there's a depth to Kyoto that's 
                    unparalleled.

                    <h2> Island in French Polynesia</h2>
                    <h5>

                      You can see the mountains wherever you are in Tahiti, 
                      with lush green valleys between them and magnificent waterfalls 
                      cascading down. The northern coast of the island is very developed, 
                      but when you visit the peninsula, Tahiti Iti, it's like stepping 
                      into another world

                    <h2> Phuket is a city in Thailand </h2>
                    <h5>

                        Phuket, a rainforested, mountainous island in the Andaman Sea, 
                        has some of Thailandâ€™s most popular beaches, mainly situated along 
                        the clear waters of the western shore. The island is home to many 
                        high-end seaside resorts, spas and restaurants. Phuket City, the 
                        capital, has old shophouses and busy markets. Patong, the main resort 
                        town, has many nightclubs, bars and discos

                        Calgary is regarded as the gateway to the 
                        Canadian Rockies with Banff being the highlight. 
                        There's so much to do and see at Banff National Park, 
                        including hiking, canoeing, skiing during the winter, 
                        plus all the wildlife and natural scenery
